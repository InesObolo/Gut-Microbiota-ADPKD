Title: Gut Microbiota and Kidney Function in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease Participants in Cameroon: A Cross-Sectional Study

Description: This README file provides essential information about the dataset from a cross-sectional study on the relationship between gut microbiota composition and kidney function in individuals with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) conducted in Cameroon.

Data Types:

Clinical Data
Biological Data (serum creatinine from blood, urine dipstick results from urine)
Microbiota Data (Quantitative PCR results)
Statistical Analysis Outputs
Data Collection: Clinical, biological and microbiota data were collected from ADPKD participants and control groups at Yaoundé University Teaching and General Hospitals. Data collection methods included questionnaires, biological sample collection and laboratory analyses.

Variables:

Age
Symptoms (e.g., flank pain, hypertension)
Kidney function parameters (e.g., estimated glomerular filtration rate)
Abundance of specific gut bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus)

Metadata:

Participant demographics
Clinical characteristics
Microbiota quantification methods
